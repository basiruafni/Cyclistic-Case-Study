# Cyclistic-Case-Study
I completed the Case-Study for Google Data Analytics Certificate. In order to answer the key business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. The purpose of this script is to consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single data frame and then conduct simple analysis to help answer the 3 key questions: “How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently?”, "Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?", "3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to inﬂuence casual riders to become members?".
I used Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Downloaded the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data (https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). (Note: The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license(https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).) This is public data that I used to explore how diﬀerent customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit me from using riders’ personally identiﬁable information. This means that I won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
